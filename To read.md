## Mathematical
- Type Theory: Two routes here, first check Hindley and Seldin's Lambda calculus and then this http://www.paultaylor.eu/stable/Proofs+Types
- Type Theory: route 2 http://purelytheoretical.com/sywtltt.html
- Topos theory: check topoi from goldblatt, check other books too
- Computability: First check Enderton's then read Cooper's computability theory
- Second order logic: Finish Enderton's 4th chapter and then go to Shapiro's book. Simpson's book seems a little bit harder and should only be tackled once you learn topology and measure theory.
- Lattice theory: (Kinda niche, not really sure if worth it now) Start with Davey and Priestley's book and then check Gratzer's for advanced topics. Continuos Lattices are a thing, check Dana Scott.
- Proof theory (Natural deduction, Prawitz)
- https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0002-3 looks good

# Trabajo de filosofia de lenguaje
- Leer primero a Weinberg. Luego leer (no en este orden) a Overgaard, Williamson y Bennett. Leer meaning, frames, and conceptual reps; el articulo de Stuart, checkear el resto del libro a ver que tal (leer a barsalou antes si se leera el libro). Tratar de conseguir el articul 'armchair metaphysics' de Jackson. Checkear el Cambridge companion to philosophical methodology.
- Check the 'Experimental philosophy' edited by knobe. Try to get the 'experimental philosophy and its critics' by Horvath. 'Are philosophers expert intuiters?' is in that book. Check if it's worth reading https://philpapers.org/rec/NAGIAE Maybe check an article of Bealer
- View from nowhere - nagel, y que ciertos autores le han respondido
